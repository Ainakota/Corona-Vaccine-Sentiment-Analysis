# Corona-Vaccine-Sentiment-Analysis
This sentiment analysis examines the tweets that were sent in reaction to the COVID-19 vaccines.

This project employs natural language processing to analyse the sentiment of tweets on the COVID-19 vaccines.

To compare the general sentiment in tweets concerning Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, tweets are analysed according to the pharma company that is referenced in the tweet (if any).

To identify pockets of positive and negative emotion across Canada, these sentiments will be combined with geographic information. The popularity of good vs. negative tweets across several English-speaking countries will be compared through an analysis of retweets and likes.
